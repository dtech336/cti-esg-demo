# CTI ESG Demo – A Small Demo to Show how i can contribute effectively.

If you’re reading this, I’m genuinely excited  because this demo is the best way for me to show you how I think, how I work, and how quickly I take action.

CTI’s mission sits exactly where I want to be:  
**sustainability, AI, data quality, and real impact.**  
So instead of just telling you I’m motivated
I built something you can actually try.

This is a tiny, focused demo not polished for production, but created to give you a clear sense of how I approach validation logic, ESG data integrity, and reviewer-ready output.

It’s my way of saying:

**“Here’s a glimpse of what I can bring to the team.  
Give me real workflows, and I’ll build real value.”**

## What this demo does

This mini-tool simulates a lightweight ESG data checking workflow:

- Upload ESG CSV data  
- Validate key fields and formats  
- Detect missing values, anomalies, inconsistencies  
- Highlight issues clearly and simply  
- Provide a quick quality overview  

It mirrors the type of early-stage review an analyst might perform before trusting or enriching ESG data.

I kept it simple on purpose — clarity first, noise second.

## Why I built it

Because CTI’s work is meaningful.  
Because data integrity matters.  
Because I believe that showing beats telling.

This demo reflects how I approach real tasks:

- structured thinking  
- careful review  
- focus on edge cases  
- clean communication of issues  
- bias toward action  

If this is what I create on my own for a demo, imagine what I could do with real data, real reports, and a real team.

## How to run

1. Open `index.html`  
2. Load the sample CSV or your own file  
3. Review the issues and quality output  

It’s intentionally lightweight — just open and test.

##Thank you for taking a moment to review this.  
I wanted to give you something tangible, not theoretical.  
If we get the chance to work together, I’d love to contribute to CTI’s mission and help build the kind of ESG data workflows that raise the bar for the whole industry.

**Looking forward to speaking with you  and hopefully working together soon.**
